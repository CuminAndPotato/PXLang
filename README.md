# PXLang

This approach is about creating a neat language for writing PXL-Apps that will finally run on the PXL-Clock.

The core uses the type inference solver from [TypeFighter](https://github.com/SchlenkR/TypeFighter). Go there to get an impression on what the current state of the solver is and what things it can do for you :)

## Key features of tha language:

> A **Complete** Language
> Focus on **Smaller Programs**
> **Robust** through static typing
> Well-suited for **top-notch editor support**
> It's **Friendly to Beginners** (and anyone else, too :) 
> **AI likes it**, too.

**Feels like python, robust like Rust**

A statically typed language requiring no or only a few type annotations.

**Specialized (or general?) syntax for state-aware function composition**

A syntax that allows for composing state-aware functions. The goal ist to 

The goal is to combine 2 things:

In contrast to existing syntaxes like TypeScript's or C#'s "await", Haskell's "do" notation of F#'s computation expressions, there shall be no special syntax used; so for both "elevated" expressions and normal expressions no special keywords or binding hints are required.

Yet, type inference shall work well.

**Beginner Friendly**

Whatever this could mean? We'll find out :)
